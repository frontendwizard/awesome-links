# Ideas
> This is a list of all the ideas that runs through my head randomly.

- **IMPORTANT** A portfolio for my coding skill and side projects.
- An application for categorizing and managing my links through the web.
- An application that manages sales and inventory. *I'm aware that this is reinventing the weel, but I need to sharpen my development skills*
